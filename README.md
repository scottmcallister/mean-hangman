# mean-hangman

A MEAN stack web app for playing hangman. This app uses Typescript across the entire
stack and Angular 2 on the front end. The Mongo database has a collection of "phrases"
containing well known movie quotes.

A running instance of this app can be found [here](https://ng2-hangman.herokuapp.com/).
